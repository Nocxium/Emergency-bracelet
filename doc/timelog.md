## Team meetings
- 2021-16-12. First team meeting. Attending was all group members from time from 12 til 16. Mainly planning and brainstorming. Also basic testing of some components including two of the sensors (vibrationsensor and pulsesensor)

- 2021-17-12. All members attending. Time 12-16. This days agenda is too program the sensors we have available for the moment. Those being vibrationsensor and fallsensor

- 2021-20-12. All members attending, Time 10-17. Some problems with the sensors we have available for the moment, orderered a new one and focusing on connectivity and app this day.

- 2021-21-12. All members attending from time 10-16. Vibration sensor was looked upon and also the app Ivan is trying to create. The focus today was to fix issues with the vibrationsensor when it gave weird values when not vibrating. Second focus was to send the data from the vibrationssensor to our app.

- 2021-22-12. All members attending from 11:45-16:30. Updated Lars about our work and worked on our fall sensor (MPU6050). We had to solder the pins to the sensor as well as update our program. 

- 2021-28-12. All members attending from 15:00-18:00. Created methods and functions for fall sensor and made the code look presentable. Discussed the button/buzzer.

- 2022-01-13. All members attending from 10-15 and also 18-22. We still have one in quarantine so working from distance. We're looking too finish the project and also fix the small problems we have.
