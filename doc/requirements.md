## Requirements
In this section we will present the requirements for our components and product.

### Mobile application
The requirements for our mobile application is to receive messages when something has happened. If something has happened the mobile application should get a popup notification (like when you get a text message from someone).

Fallsensor should only give results if there have been a fall. It should also be able to distinguish if it is a fall or some other activity (for example jumping on the couch or bed)
